Fedora Shooter
==============
A top-down shooter where you star as a giant spinning fedora and need to tip
your way out of the friendzone.

Try it out
----------
This is a silly game built using Godot Engine. The game has no official packages
yet, so the only way to play it right now is to run it directly with the engine:

0. Install Godot Engine: http://www.godotengine.org/wp/download/
1. Clone the repository: `git clone git@github.com:bdero/just-the-basics.git`
2. Run the game using Godot Engine: `godot fedora_shooter/game.xscn`

How to control
--------------
- Move using the classic W, A, S, and D keys, or the arrow keys

TODO
----
- ~~Press space to Tip ("tip" sound?)~~
- ~~Tipping shoots~~
- Title screen
- ~~Bullets (Nice Guysâ„¢?)~~
- Enemies (fedora memes/fedora "shaming"?)
- Enemy death (score? "nice meme" sound?)
- Parallax space background
- Game gets harder as time goes on
- Player death
- Score board
- Fitting music
